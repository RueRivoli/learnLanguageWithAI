# Learn languages faster with AI

This Nuxt website is a fast language learning app. It generates lessons (or stories) with the words that you don't know and focused on one of the grammar rule that you don't master.


In each new lesson, we generate for you a story containing: 
- 10 of the most 8K used words that you don't know
- an application of the grammar rule you need to improve

After reading that lesson, the user is asked to fill out a quiz.
This evaluates the progress and update the score associated to that grammar rule.

A dashboard keeps track of your knowledge of
- the 8K most used words in the targeted language
- the 1K most used expressions in the targeted language
- your skills in the different grammar rules that you need to master
