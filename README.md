## 🚀 Overview

**LinguaLAB** is a fast and intelligent language learning web app built with **Nuxt 3** and powered by **AI**.  
It dynamically generates lessons (or short stories) with:

- 🧠 The **top 8K words** you don’t know yet
- 🧩 A specific **grammar rule** you need to master

Each lesson ends with a quiz to evaluate your progress. Based on your answers, your personal knowledge base is updated.

## 📊 What It Tracks

A personal dashboard monitors your proficiency in:

- ✅ The **8,000 most common words** in the language
- ✅ The **1,000 most useful expressions**
- ✅ ✅ Your **grammar mastery** across different rules
