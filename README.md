# Learn languages faster with AI

This Nuxt.js website is about learning languages. But faster.

AI helps us to detect where stands room for improvement.

In each new lesson, we generate for you a lesson containing: 
- 10 of the most 8K used words that you don't know
- a notion that you need to improve

At the end of a lesson, the user needs to fill out a quiz.
This evaluates your progess

A dashboard keeps track of your knowledge of
- the 8K most used words in the targeted language
- the 1K most used expressions in the targeted language
- your skills in the different grammar rules that you need to master
