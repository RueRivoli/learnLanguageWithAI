    In Turkish, the suffixes “-arak” and “-erek” are used to express how an action is done or to connect two actions.
    They’re powerful tools for making your Turkish flow naturally—just like a native speaker.
    1. What Do They Mean?

The suffix “-arak / -erek” roughly translates to:

“by …ing” → expressing how something is done

“while …ing” → showing two actions happening simultaneously

“and …” → connecting two consecutive actions

In short, they make your sentences shorter, smoother, and more elegant.

2. Formation Rules

The choice between “-arak” and “-erek” depends on vowel harmony:

Formula:
Verb stem + -arak / -erek

If the last vowel in the stem is a, ı, o, u → use -arak

If the last vowel in the stem is e, i, ö, ü → use -erek

That’s it! No personal endings, no buffer letters—just vowel harmony.

3. Core Usage 1 — Expressing “By …ing”

Use “-arak/-erek” when explaining how something is done.
This makes your Turkish clearer and more efficient.

Examples
Turkish	English
Çalışarak başarılı oldum.	I became successful by working hard.
Koşarak okula gittim.	I went to school by running.
Telefonederek rezervasyon yaptım.	I made a reservation by calling.
Düşünerek karar vermelisin.	You should decide by thinking carefully.

Tip: Whenever you want to express the method or means of doing something, think “-arak/-erek.”

4. Core Usage 2 — Connecting Two Actions

Sometimes, two actions happen one after the other, and instead of using “and” (ve), you can use “-arak/-erek” to make your Turkish more fluid.

Examples
Turkish	English
Kitabı bitirerek kütüphaneye verdim.	I finished the book and returned it to the library.
Arabayı parkederek anahtarları teslim ettim.	I parked the car and handed over the keys.
Elini kaldırarak konuşmaya başladı.	He raised his hand and started speaking.
5. Core Usage 3 — Showing Simultaneous Actions

“-arak/-erek” can also mean “while …ing”, when two actions overlap.

Examples
Turkish	English
Gülerek konuşuyor.	She’s speaking while smiling.
Koşarak şarkı söylüyordu.	He was singing while running.
Araba kullanarak müzik dinliyorum.	I listen to music while driving.
6. Comparing “-arak/-erek” vs. “-ken” and “-ip”

To avoid confusion, here’s how “-arak/-erek” compares to similar forms:

Form	Meaning	Example	English
-arak/-erek	How / by doing	Gülerek konuştu	He spoke smiling
-ken	While / during	Ders çalışırken müzik dinlerim	I listen to music while studying
-ip	And then	Kalkıp kapıyı açtı	He got up and opened the door

Key takeaway:

Use “-arak/-erek” when the manner or overlap of actions matters.

Use “-ken” for “while.”

Use “-ip” for sequences.

7. Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Don’t confuse it with the gerund (-mek/-mak).

“Yürüyerek geldim” ✅ (I came by walking)

“Yürümek geldim” ❌ (incorrect)

❌ Don’t overuse “ve” (“and”)
Instead of:

“Kitabı okudum ve bitirdim.”
Better:

“Kitabı okuyup bitirdim.” ✅
Or:

“Kitabı bitirerek kütüphaneye verdim.” ✅ (more natural)

8. Practice Sentences

Try translating these into English:

Gülerek cevap verdi.

Koşarak eve geldim.

Telefon ederek bilgi aldım.

Düşünerek doğru kararı bulabilirsin.

Answers:

She replied with a smile / smiling.

I came home by running.

I got the information by calling.

You can find the right decision by thinking carefully.
