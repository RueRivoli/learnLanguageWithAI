    Turkish gerunds let you express simultaneous actions, methods, and gradual
    processes with clarity. Here are the three main gerund forms to boost your
    fluency: -ken (while/when) Expresses actions happening at the same time.
    Attach to nouns, adjectives, or the present tense verb stem. Example:
    Çalışırken müzik dinlerim. — I listen to music while working. -(y)arak /
    -(y)erek (by/while doing) Describes how an action is performed, attached to
    the verb stem. Example: Gülerek cevap verdi. — She answered by laughing.
    Verb + (y)a Verb + (y)a (by doing continuously) Shows repeated or continuous
    actions leading to a result. Example: Konuşa konuşa anlaştık. — We
    understood each other by talking continuously. Bonus: The special form
    -mişken implies “since you’re already…” helping you suggest doing something
    while another action is happening. Example: Market gitmişken bana elma alır
    mısın? — Since you’re already going to the market, can you get me some
    apples?
