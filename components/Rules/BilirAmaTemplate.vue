    One of the most versatile endings in Turkish is “-abilir/-ebilir”. It lets
    you express what you can do, what’s allowed, and what’s possible — all with
    a single suffix. Think of it as the Turkish equivalent of “can,” “may,”
    “might,” or “could.” . Three Main Uses of “-abilir/-ebilir” a) Ability —
    “can” Use it to talk about what someone is capable of doing. Ben
    yüzebilirim. → I can swim. b) Permission — “may” It can also indicate that
    someone is allowed to do something. Burada oturabilirsiniz. → You may sit
    here. c) Possibility — “might” Finally, it can express uncertainty or
    likelihood. Yarın yağmur yağabilir. → It might rain tomorrow. Tip: In most
    cases, context makes the meaning clear — you don’t need to overthink it. 2.
    How to Form “-abilir/-ebilir” Formula: Verb stem + (y) + a/e + bilir +
    personal ending Start with the verb stem: e.g., yap- (to do). If the stem
    ends with a vowel, add “y” first: yürü- → yürüyebilirim. Choose -a or -e
    based on vowel harmony. Add bilir + the personal ending. Examples with
    “yapmak” (to do): Turkish English Ben yapabilirim I can do it Sen
    yapabilirsin You can do it O yapabilir He/She can do it Biz yapabiliriz We
    can do it Siz yapabilirsiniz You (formal/plural) can do it Onlar
    yapabilir(ler) They can do it 3. Negative Forms: “-emez/-amaz” To say
    “can’t” or “not allowed to,” you drop -bil and use -emez/-amaz instead.
    Formula: Verb stem + (y) + a/e + maz/mez + personal ending Examples: Yapamam
    → I can’t do it. Yürüyemezsin → You can’t walk. Burada sigara içemezsiniz →
    You can’t smoke here. This can mean inability or prohibition — context
    decides. 4. Expressing Uncertainty: “-mayabilir” There’s another, softer
    negative form: “-mayabilir/-meyebilir.” It expresses possibility of NOT
    doing something rather than complete inability. Formula: Verb stem + ma/me +
    y + a/e + bilir + personal ending Examples: Gelmeyebilirim → I might not
    come. Bilmeyebilirsin → You might not know. Yemek istemeyebilirim → I might
    not want to eat. This is more flexible than -emez/-amaz, which is absolute.
    5. Using “Ama” with “-abilir/-ebilir” The word “ama” means “but” and is
    commonly used to contrast expectations — perfect for pairing with
    “-abilir/-ebilir” forms. Examples: Bilmeyebilirsin, ama denemelisin. → You
    might not know, but you should try. Hava çok soğuk, ama dışarı çıkabiliriz.
    → It’s very cold, but we can still go outside. Gitmek istemeyebilirim, ama
    gerekirse giderim. → I might not want to go, but I’ll go if necessary. Key
    Takeaway: Use “ama” to soften contradictions and make your sentences sound
    natural and fluent. 6. Quick Comparison Table Meaning Positive Form Negative
