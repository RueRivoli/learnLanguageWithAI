        One of the most versatile endings in Turkish is “-abilir/-ebilir”. It lets you express what you can do, what’s allowed, and what’s possible — all with a single suffix. Think of it as the Turkish equivalent of “can,” “may,” “might,” or “could.”
        . Three Main Uses of “-abilir/-ebilir”
a) Ability — “can”

Use it to talk about what someone is capable of doing.

Ben yüzebilirim. → I can swim.

b) Permission — “may”

It can also indicate that someone is allowed to do something.

Burada oturabilirsiniz. → You may sit here.

c) Possibility — “might”

Finally, it can express uncertainty or likelihood.

Yarın yağmur yağabilir. → It might rain tomorrow.

Tip: In most cases, context makes the meaning clear — you don’t need to overthink it.

2. How to Form “-abilir/-ebilir”

Formula:
Verb stem + (y) + a/e + bilir + personal ending

Start with the verb stem: e.g., yap- (to do).

If the stem ends with a vowel, add “y” first: yürü- → yürüyebilirim.

Choose -a or -e based on vowel harmony.

Add bilir + the personal ending.

Examples with “yapmak” (to do):

Turkish	English
Ben yapabilirim	I can do it
Sen yapabilirsin	You can do it
O yapabilir	He/She can do it
Biz yapabiliriz	We can do it
Siz yapabilirsiniz	You (formal/plural) can do it
Onlar yapabilir(ler)	They can do it
3. Negative Forms: “-emez/-amaz”

To say “can’t” or “not allowed to,” you drop -bil and use -emez/-amaz instead.

Formula:
Verb stem + (y) + a/e + maz/mez + personal ending

Examples:

Yapamam → I can’t do it.

Yürüyemezsin → You can’t walk.

Burada sigara içemezsiniz → You can’t smoke here.

This can mean inability or prohibition — context decides.

4. Expressing Uncertainty: “-mayabilir”

There’s another, softer negative form: “-mayabilir/-meyebilir.”
It expresses possibility of NOT doing something rather than complete inability.

Formula:
Verb stem + ma/me + y + a/e + bilir + personal ending

Examples:

Gelmeyebilirim → I might not come.

Bilmeyebilirsin → You might not know.

Yemek istemeyebilirim → I might not want to eat.

This is more flexible than -emez/-amaz, which is absolute.

5. Using “Ama” with “-abilir/-ebilir”

The word “ama” means “but” and is commonly used to contrast expectations — perfect for pairing with “-abilir/-ebilir” forms.

Examples:

Bilmeyebilirsin, ama denemelisin.
→ You might not know, but you should try.

Hava çok soğuk, ama dışarı çıkabiliriz.
→ It’s very cold, but we can still go outside.

Gitmek istemeyebilirim, ama gerekirse giderim.
→ I might not want to go, but I’ll go if necessary.

Key Takeaway:

Use “ama” to soften contradictions and make your sentences sound natural and fluent.
