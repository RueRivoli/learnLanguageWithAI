    In Turkish, when two nouns come together to describe one idea, they form a compound noun — also called nominal compounds. Unlike English, Turkish often marks these compounds with a special ending: -sı / -si / -su / -sü or -ı / -i / -u / -ü, depending on vowel harmony.

Think of it as a glue that ties the words into one smooth concept. Once you understand the pattern, you’ll start spotting it everywhere.

. The Core Formula

Noun 1 + Noun 2 + (s) + i/ı/u/ü

If the second noun ends with a consonant → just add an i-type vowel.

If the second noun ends with a vowel → insert -s before the vowel.

Examples

Bebek sandalyesi → baby chair → high chair

Cep telefonu → pocket phone → cell phone

Kol saati → wrist clock → wristwatch

Hayal dünyası → dream world

Pazar günü → bazaar day → Sunday

2. When the Final Letter Changes

If the second noun ends in ç, k, p, t, these consonants soften before adding the ending:

Original	Changes To	Example	Meaning
ç → c	Araç → itfaiye aracı	fire truck	
k → ğ	Yemek → akşam yemeği	evening meal	
p → b	Kebap → tavuk şiş kebabı	chicken shish kebab	
t → d	Kâğıt → duvar kâğıdı	wallpaper	

But… beware! There are exceptions where no change happens, especially with words ending in -t:

Yurt içi → domestic

Türkiye Cumhuriyeti → Republic of Turkey

Futbol topu → soccer ball

3. Compound Nouns That Become One Word

Some compounds are used so often that they evolve into single words:

Base Words	New Word	Meaning
gök + kuşak	gökkuşağı	rainbow
buz + dolap	buzdolabı	refrigerator
dil + bilgi	dilbilgisi	linguistics
ayak + kap	ayakkabı	shoe
soy + ad	soyadı	surname

Fun fact: Once a compound becomes one word, you can add another compound ending on top of it:

Çocuk ayakkabısı → children’s shoes

4. Dropping Vowels

Some nouns lose their final vowel when adding the ending — but vowel harmony still follows the dropped vowel, not the one you see:

İzin → oturma izni → residence permit

Vakit → namaz vakti → prayer time

Akit → hizmet akti → service agreement

5. When There’s No Ending at All

Not all compounds take a suffix. Sometimes, Turkish works like English — just put two nouns together:

Pamuk şeker → cotton candy

Taş köprü → stone bridge

Altın kolye → gold necklace

Parmak patates → French fries

6. Repeated Consonants

Some compounds double the last consonant in writing and pronunciation:

Metro hattı → metro line

Telif hakkı → copyright

Ücret zammı → wage increase

7. Special Cases & Rare Exceptions
A. Double Vowels

Words like cami (mosque) and bayi (dealer) form compounds by doubling the vowel:

Sultan Ahmet Camii → Sultan Ahmet Mosque

Tekel bayii → liquor store

B. Words Ending in “-nk”

Some words ending in -nk use a hard g instead of the usual soft ğ:

Kahve + renk → kahverengi → brown (coffee color)

Yılbaşı + fiyonk → yılbaşı fiyongu → Christmas bow

8. Quick Summary

Final Tip

If you want to sound natural, don’t memorize lists. Instead, listen and read as much as possible. Turkish compound nouns are everywhere — in street names, products, brands, and headlines. The more you notice them, the faster they’ll become second nature.
