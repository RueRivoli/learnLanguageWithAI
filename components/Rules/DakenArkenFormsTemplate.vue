        In Turkish, the suffixes “-daken” and “-arken” are used to express “while doing” or “during the time that.”
They help you connect two actions happening simultaneously, making your Turkish sound smooth, natural, and more advanced.
1. What Do They Mean?

Both “-daken” and “-arken” mean “while …” or “when …” in English.
They are used when two actions overlap in time:

“While I was eating, she called me.”
“When I was studying, it started raining.”

In Turkish, instead of using an extra word like “while” in English, you attach “-daken” or “-arken” directly to the verb.

2. Formation Rules

The choice between “-daken” and “-arken” depends on vowel harmony and whether the verb ends with a vowel or a consonant.

Formula:

Verb stem + -(y)erken / -(y)arken / -(y)daken / -(y)darken

If the verb ends with a consonant → -arken / -erken

If the verb ends with a vowel → add a buffer “y” → -yorken / -yerken

Use e or a depending on vowel harmony:

Front vowels (e, i, ö, ü) → -erken

Back vowels (a, ı, o, u) → -arken

3. Using “-arken” (Most Common Form)

“-arken” is the default and most common form used for simultaneous actions in the present, past, or future.

Examples
Turkish	English
Ders çalışırken müzik dinliyorum.	I listen to music while studying.
Yemek yerken konuşma!	Don’t talk while eating!
Spor yaparken telefonum çaldı.	My phone rang while exercising.
Film izlerken uyuyakaldım.	I fell asleep while watching a movie.

Tip:
When the verb stem ends with a vowel, insert “y” before -erken/-arken:

yemek → yerken (eating → while eating)

okumak → okurken (reading → while reading)

4. Using “-daken”

The form “-daken” works the same way but is used when the verb is in the past continuous tense (-dAk form). It emphasizes “at the time when something was happening”.

This structure is less common and slightly more formal than “-arken.”

Examples
Turkish	English
Yürümekteyken yağmur başladı.	It started raining while I was walking.
Uyuyorken telefon çalmış.	The phone rang while I was sleeping.
Tatildeyken yeni insanlarla tanıştım.	I met new people while on vacation.

Key difference:

“-arken” → neutral, common, everyday speech.

“-daken” → slightly formal, sometimes used in narratives or writing.

5. Comparing “-arken” vs. “-daken”
Feature	-arken	-daken
Meaning	While / When	While / When
Tone	Neutral, daily speech	Slightly formal, literary
Tense	Works in all tenses	Often linked to past continuous
Frequency	Very common	Less common
6. Example Sentences with Both

Müzik dinlerken ders çalışamam.
→ I can’t study while listening to music. (colloquial)

Müzik dinlemekteyken ders çalışamadım.
→ I couldn’t study while I was listening to music. (formal/emphatic)

Both are correct, but the first one is what you’ll hear 95% of the time in everyday conversations.

7. Pro Tips to Sound Natural

Use “-arken” in almost all daily contexts.

Save “-daken” for formal writing, literature, or when you want to emphasize “at that very moment.”

Always pay attention to vowel harmony when forming these endings.

Practice with short, real-life sentences to make it automatic.
