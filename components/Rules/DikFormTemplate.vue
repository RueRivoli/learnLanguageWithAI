    Using ‑dık to form relative clauses If you are wanting to describe something
    specific in order to differentiate it from something else, you might use an
    adjective like “big” or “green.” However, there are times when a simple
    adjective like this isn’t enough to get your point across. Sometimes you
    need a verb or even a long series of words to specify which kind of thing
    you are talking about. Relative clauses are one of the ways to do that. In
    this lesson, we will look at one of the word endings that you can use to
    form relative clauses: ‑dık. The ‑dık ending is used for talking about
    things that happened in the past or are happening in the present. Grammar
    forms (Verb stem) + dığ/diğ/duğ/düğ + (personal possessive ending) (Verb
    stem) + dık/dik/duk/dük + ları/leri (Verb stem ending with ç, k, p, s, ş or
    t) + tığ/tiğ/tuğ/tüğ + (personal possessive ending) (Verb stem ending with
    ç, k, p, s, ş or t) + tık/tik/tuk/tük + ları/leri To use the ‑dık ending to
    make a relative clause, the first thing you need to do is to find the verb
    stem (e.g. the “yap” part of “yapmak”). If the verb stem ends with a
    voiceless consonant (“ç,” “k,” “p,” “s,” “ş” or “t”), then the first letter
    of the ending will be “t.” Otherwise, the first letter will be “d.” Next,
    you will add a vowel: “ı,” “i,” “u,” or “ü,” according to I-type vowel
    harmony with the verb stem. After that, you add either a soft “ğ” or a “k”
    followed by one of the personal possessive endings (e.g. ‑ım, ‑ın, ‑ı,
    ‑ımız, ‑ınız, ‑ları). You will use a “k” with the third person plural
    ‑ları/leri ending and a soft “ğ” with all the other personal possessive
    endings. It should also be noted that the full form of the -dık relative
    clauses technically includes a possessive pronoun such as “benim,” “senin,”
    or “onun.” However, since the meaning of this pronoun is also contained in
    the possessive ending, the pronoun is usually omitted. To begin with, let’s
    see how the ‑dık ending gets used with different personal possessive endings
    on a few of the most common verbs: The ‑dık ending on “yapmak” (to do)
    Turkish English (Benim) yaptığım şey The thing that I did (Senin) yaptığın
    şey The thing that you did (Onun) yaptığı şey The thing that he/she/it did
    (Bizim) yaptığımız şey The thing that we did (Sizin) yaptığınız şey The
    thing that you (pl. or formal) did (Onların) yaptığı / yaptıkları şey The
    thing that they did The ‑dık ending on “almak” (to take) Turkish English
    (Benim) aldığım şey The thing that I took (Senin) aldığın şey The thing that
    you took (Onun) aldığı şey The thing that he/she/it took (Bizim) aldığımız
    şey The thing that we took (Sizin) aldığınız şey The thing that you (pl. or
    formal) took (Onların) aldığı / aldıkları şey The thing that they took The
    ‑dık ending on “vermek” (to give) Turkish English (Benim) verdiğim şey The
    thing that I gave (Senin) verdiğin şey The thing that you gave (Onun)
    verdiği şey The thing that he/she/it gave (Bizim) verdiğimiz şey The thing
    that we gave (Sizin) verdiğiniz şey The thing that you (pl. or formal) gave
    (Onların) verdiği / verdikleri şey The thing that they gave Past tense
    relative clauses with ‑dık Now let’s look at some examples of how the ‑dık
    ending is used to form relative clauses about things that happened in the
    past. Example sentences* Aradığınız kişi şu anda başka biri ile konuşuyor.
    The person you called is currently talking with another person. (The
    standard message you get when a line is busy) Sipariş ettiğiniz ürünler
    hazır. The products that you ordered are ready. Burada benim yaptığım bir
    araştırma var. There is an investigation that I did here. Görev yaptığım
    dönem 1995 yılıydı. The time period that I served was the year 1995. Eski
    çalıştığı gemiydi. It was the ship where he/she used to work. Yaptığı
    transferler ortada. The transfers that he/she made are obvious. Sizin inşa
    ettiğiniz bir ev. [This is] a house that you built. Sizin seçtiğiniz bir
    duruş var. There is a stance that you have chosen. Önceden aldıkları numune
    çöpteydi. The sample that they had taken earlier was garbage. Genç yaşta
    geldikleri nokta önemli. The point that they reached at a young age is
    important. Present tense relative clauses with ‑dık Besides making relative
    clauses in the past tense, ‑dık can also be used to make relative clauses
    about things that are currently happening, things that are ongoing, happen
    habitually, or for topics that don’t necessarily have a specific time
    associated with them. In some cases, it can be ambiguous whether a verb with
    the ‑dık ending is referring to something that happened in the past or
    something that is happening in the present. You sometimes need to use
    context clues to figure out whether it refers to the past or the present.
    Example sentences with present tense, ongoing, habitual or unspecific
    timeframes Merak ettiğim sorular var. There are [some] questions that I am
    curious about. Takdir ettiğimiz nokta bu. This is the point that we admire
    [about them]. Zira oturdukları evler dar. Because the houses where they live
    are small. İkimizin de istediği bu. This is what both of us want/wanted.
    Fakat sizinle paylaşmak istediğim bir şey var. But there’s something that I
    want/wanted to share with you. Şelale ve pınarın olduğu yer muhteşem. The
    place where the waterfall and spring are is magnificent. Making negatives
    and double negatives As with other verb endings, the -dık relative clause
    ending can combine with the negative verb ending -ma/me. The result is a
    relative clause that is negated, as in “the things that didn’t happen.” You
    can also negate the verb in the main sentence to produce a different
    meaning, as in “I didn’t know about the thing he/she did.” You can also form
    a double negative sentence by negating both the verb of the main sentence
    and the relative clause verb. Negative examples Evet yapmadığın çok şey
    vardı. Yes, there were a lot of things that you did not do. Pes ettiğiniz
    anlar olmadı mı? Weren’t there times when you gave up? Yurtdışında
    kazanmadığı ödül yok. There is no award that he/she has not won abroad.
    Making more complicated sentences using case endings There are a lot of ways
    to combine the -dık relative clause ending with other grammar forms to
    express complex ideas. One way to form more complicated sentences is to add
    word endings onto the noun that the -dık relative clause is describing. Some
    of the most common noun endings are the grammatical case endings: the
    accusative case ending -(y)ı/i/u/ü, the dative case ending -(y)a/e, the
    locative case ending -da/de/ta/te, the ablative case -dan/den/tan/ten. In
    addition to going on the noun that the relative clause is describing, these
    case endings can be added to nouns inside the relative clause itself as
    well. Examples with case endings inside relative clauses Avrupa’da da
    görmediğim ülke kalmadı. There’s no country left in Europe that I haven’t
    seen. İşte ondan beklediğim davranış buydu. This was the behavior that I
    expected from him/her. Examples with case endings outside relative clauses
    İstediğiniz yere geldiniz. You’ve arrived at the place that you want/wanted
    [to go to]. (From the Turkish audio instructions in Google Maps) Ben
    yaptığım işi çok seviyorum. I really love the job that I do. Hedeflediğimiz
    rakamlara ulaştık. We reached the figures that we were targeting.
    Hedeflediğimiz yolda gidiyoruz. We are moving forward on the path that we
    were aiming for. Hiç ses çıkarmadı. Öyle kaldı olduğu yerde. He/She didn’t
    make a sound. Just stayed in the place where he/she was. Verdiği örneğe de
    bak. Look at the example that he/she gave. Saklandığım yerden çıktım. I came
    out from the place where I was hiding. Attığımız her adımı biliriz. We know
    every step that we took. Onların yaktığı ateşte yandım. I was burned up in
    the fire that they lit. Galiba biz istediğimiz ortamları bulduk. I think
    we’ve found the environments that we want/wanted. Bilmediğiniz kelimelere
    bakarsınız. You can look up words that you don’t know. Şu anda memnunum
    oynadığım yerden. I’m satisfied with the place where I’m playing right now.
    “Headless” relative clauses There is another way to use the -dık relative
    clause ending that is particularly challenging for language learners: the
    so-called “headless” relative clauses. The “head” of a relative clause is
    the person, place or thing that the relative clause is describing (i.e., the
    noun that comes after the verb with the -dık ending). However, there are two
    types of sentences in Turkish where you can use a -dık relative clause
    without a head noun: When the person, place or thing being described by the
    relative clause is either obvious or irrelevant: “the one that…” When the
    verb itself is the whole point of the relative clause, as in the phrase,
    “the fact that…” Example sentences with headless relative clauses Arabanın
    çalıştığı belli değil. Sessiz yani. It’s not clear that the car is running.
    It’s quiet, that is. Hocanın da bir bildiği var sonuçta. After all, the
    teacher has [something] that he/she knows. Benim yaptığım bu. This is what I
    did. Tahmin ettiğiniz olmadı. What you predicted didn’t happen. Benim tahmin
    ettiğim oldu. What that I predicted happened. Kızgın olduğu çok açıktı. It
    was very clear that he/she was angry. Korktuğum gerçekleşti. What I feared
    came true. Uzmanların istediği oldu. What the experts wanted happened. Şehre
    güzellik kattığı kesin. It’s certain that it added beauty to the city.
    Söylemek istediğim bu. This is what I want to say. Burada yapmak istediğim
    bu. This is what I want to do here. Ne kadar haksız olduğu ortaya çıktı. It
    became apparent how unjust it was. Headless relative clauses with case
    endings In the cases of headless relative clauses, the whole relative clause
    acts like a noun in the main sentence. And since it acts like a noun, it can
    also receive noun endings such as the accusative case, dative case, etc.
    Here are some example sentences where the whole relative clause receives a
    case ending. Note that for the case of the third person singular -dığı and
    plural -dıkları, you have to add the so-called n buffer before adding a case
    ending, just like you do when adding case endings to compound nouns. This
    can create some ambiguous sentences where it may not be immediately clear
    whether the ending is third person (-dığı) with the “n buffer” or if it is
    second person (-dığın). Headless relative clauses with accusative case
    endings Haklı olduğumu göreceksiniz. You will see that I am right. Ne
    söylediğini bilmiyor. He doesn’t know what he is saying / said. (This can
    also technically mean, “He doesn’t know what you are saying / said”)
    Kalorili olduğunu unutmayın! Don’t forget that it’s high in calories!
    Aradığımı buldum. I found what I was looking for. Depresyona girdiğini
    görüyorsunuz. You see that he/she is depressed. Ne düşündüğümü sorarlar.
    They ask what I am thinking. Zeki biri olduğumu söylerler. They say that I
    am smart. Headless relative clauses with dative case endings Tanıştığımıza
    memnun oldum. I’m glad that we met. (A common saying) Ağır olmadığına
    inanıyorum. I believe that it’s not heavy. Doğru seçim yaptığımıza
    inanıyoruz. We believe that we made the right choice. Bunun doğru olduğuna
    inanmak istiyorum. I want to believe that this is right. Ama söylediğinize
    de katılıyorum. But I also agree with what you said. Burada olduğunuza
    sevindim. I’m glad that you are here. Anlayış gösterdiğine sevindim. I’m
    glad that you showed understanding. Umarım sorduğunuza pişman olmazsınız. I
    hope you won’t regret what you asked. Example sentences with ablative case
    endings Beni sevdiğinden emin değilim. I’m not sure that he/she loves me.
    Dediğinden sakın çıkmayın. Do not deviate from what he/she said. Ben her
    yaşadığımdan dersimi alıyorum. I learn my lesson from everything that I live
    through. Çeviri yapmak istediğimden söz ettim. I talked about how I want to
    do translation. Example sentences with genitive case (possessive) endings Ne
    olduğunun önemi yok. It doesn’t matter what happened (Literally, what
    happened has no importance.) Normalde beklediğimizin tam tersi. It’s the
    exact opposite of what we normally expect. Demek istediğimizin özeti buydu.
    This was the summary of what we wanted to say. For further study Relative
    clauses using ‑an/en and ‑acak/ecek Besides using the ‑dık ending, there are
    two other primary ways to form relative clauses in Turkish: the ‑an/en
    relative clause ending and the ‑acak/ecek relative clause ending. The
    ‑acak/ecek ending works almost the same way as ‑dık except that it is used
    for relative clauses in the future tense instead of past or present. The
    ‑an/en ending, on the other hand, is different from both. You can only use
    ‑an/en if the noun that’s being described by the relative clause is the
    grammatical subject of the relative clause. In other words, the noun that
    you’re describing with the ‑an/en relative clause has to be the person or
    thing that is doing the verb that gets the ‑an/en ending. Using more complex
    ‑dık forms Besides these additional word endings for relative clauses, there
    are a lot of ways to build upon your knowledge of the ‑dık ending by
    combining it with other grammatical words and word endings. Here is a sample
    of the various ways ‑dık is used in the Turkish language. Turkish English
    Yaptığım için Because I did it Yaptığıma göre Since we know that I did it
    Yaptığıma dair Regarding what I did Yaptığım zaman, yaptığımda When I did it
    / when I do it Yaptığımdan beri Ever since I did it Yapabildiğim The
    thing(s) that I am/was able to do Yaptığım gibi Similar to what I did
    Yaptığım sürece As long as I do it / keep doing it Yaptığım kadar As much as
    I did Yapabildiğince As much as I can do Ne kadar yaptığıma bağlı It depends
    on how much I did
