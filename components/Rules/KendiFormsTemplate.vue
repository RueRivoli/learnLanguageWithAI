    Mastering “Kendi” in Turkish You’ve already seen “kendi” used like this:
    kendi evim – my own house kendim yapıyorum – I’m doing it myself Now, let’s
    take it a step further! 1. Using “kendi” like “self” (as a noun) You can use
    “kendi” with noun endings to say things like “to myself” or “with yourself.”
    Structure: kendim / kendini / kendine / kendinden / kendinle / kendin için,
    etc. ✅ Kendimi affettim – I forgave myself ✅ Kendine güveniyor musun? – Do
    you trust yourself? 💡 In the 3rd person, the “-si” is often dropped:
    “kendi” becomes the base. 2. Emphatic “kendi kendi” Repeating “kendi” makes
    it more expressive or dramatic, often used in writing. ✅ Kendi kendimi
    şaşırttım – I surprised myself ✅ Kendi kendine konuşuyor – He/she is
    talking to themselves Use it when someone really does something solo, or
    unexpectedly. 3. “Kendi kendine” = All by oneself This special form
    emphasizes doing something completely alone — more surprising in Turkish
    culture than in Western contexts. ✅ Kendi kendime yaptım – I did it all by
    myself ✅ Facebook kendi kendine paylaşım yapıyor – Facebook is posting by
    itself
