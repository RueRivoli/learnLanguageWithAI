These small but powerful endings will make your sentences more natural, expressive, and fluent. Let’s break it down in a simple, modern, and fun way!

Reflexive Verbs (-n endings) → “Doing something to yourself”

Use these when the subject and object are the same person — basically when someone acts on themselves.

Formula:
Verb stem + n / ın / in / un / ün (based on vowel harmony)

Examples:

Yıkanmak → “to wash oneself” (from “yıkamak” → “to wash [something]”)

Giyinmek → “to get dressed” (from “giymek” → “to wear”)

Saklanmak → “to hide oneself”  (from “saklamak” → “to hide [something]”)

💡 Quick Tip: If the action comes back to you, use the reflexive form!

🔹 Passive Verbs (-ıl endings) → “Something is done”

Want to make your sentences sound smoother and less direct? Use the passive form when the subject doesn’t do the action — instead, the action happens.

Formula:
Verb stem + ıl / il / ul / ül (vowel harmony again!)

Examples:

Yapılmak → “to be done” (from “yapmak” → “to do”)

Görülmek → “to be seen” (from “görmek” → “to see”)

Anlaşılmak → “to be understood” (from “anlamak” → “to understand”)

Usage:

Ev temizlendi. → “The house was cleaned.”

Karar verildi. → “A decision was made.”
