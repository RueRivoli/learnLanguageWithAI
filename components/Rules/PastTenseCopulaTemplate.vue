In Turkish, expressing the idea of “was” is a bit different from English. While verbs in the past take the -dı/di/du/dü ending, when describing what someone or something was, you need the past tense copula:

idi → shortened to -(y)dı / -(y)di / -(y)du / -(y)dü

The short form -(y)dı is used in everyday Turkish, while idi appears mostly in formal writing and official contexts.

1. The Two Forms
Form	Usage	Example	Meaning
idi	Formal, written, rare	Güzel idi	It was beautiful
-(y)dı	Everyday, natural	Güzeldi	It was beautiful

Think of idi as “classical Turkish” and -(y)dı as “modern Turkish.”

2. How to Form -(y)dı

The ending changes based on:

Whether the base word ends in a vowel or consonant

Whether the last consonant is voiced or voiceless

Vowel harmony

Step 1 — Check the last letter:

If the word ends in a vowel, insert -y:

öğrenci → öğrenciydi → “he/she was a student”

If the word ends in a consonant, no “y” needed:

güzel → güzeldi → “it was beautiful”

Step 2 — Pick “t” or “d”:

If the last consonant is voiceless (ç, k, p, s, ş, t) → use t:

çocuk → çocuktu → “he/she was a child”

Otherwise, use d:

öğrenci → öğrenciydi

Step 3 — Apply vowel harmony:
Choose ı, i, u, ü based on the last vowel in the word:

a/ı → dı

e/i → di

o/u → du

ö/ü → dü

4. Adding Personal Endings (“I was”, “You were”, etc.)

Attach personal endings directly to idi or -(y)dı:

Pronoun	Form	Example	Meaning
Ben	-dim	Gençtim	I was young
Sen	-din	Gençtin	You were young
O	-di	Gençti	He/She was young
Biz	-dik	Gençtik	We were young
Siz	-diniz	Gençtiniz	You were young (plural/formal)
Onlar	-di / -diler	Gençtiler	They were young

Tip: For “onlar,” the plural ending -lar/ler is optional:

Onlar gençti ✔️

Onlar gençlerdi ✔️

Both are correct.

5. Making Negatives: “Wasn’t”

Use değil (“not”) + idi / -(y)di:

Turkish	Meaning
Bu değildi.	It wasn’t this.
Niyetim kötü değildi.	My intention wasn’t bad.
Kolay değildi.	It wasn’t easy.
6. Talking About Existence: “There was / wasn’t”

Use vardı (“there was”) and yoktu (“there wasn’t”):

Turkish	Meaning
Bir melek vardı.	There was an angel.
Gerek yoktu.	There was no need.
Haberim yoktu.	I didn’t know.
7. Asking Questions: “Was it…?”

To form yes/no questions, use mı/mi/mu/mü + -(y)dı:

Turkish	Meaning
Yalan mıydı?	Was it a lie?
Değer miydi?	Was it worth it?
Pollyanna mutlu muydu?	Was Pollyanna happy?
Türk müydü?	Was he/she Turkish?
8. Quick Recap

Use -(y)dı for “was” in everyday Turkish.

Add -y if the word ends with a vowel.

Use t after voiceless consonants, d otherwise.

Match vowels using i-type vowel harmony.

Personal endings let you say “I was,” “you were,” etc.

Combine with değil, var, yok, and mı for negatives, existence, and questions.
